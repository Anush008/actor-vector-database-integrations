This repository contains Actors for different vector databases. 
The Actors are designed to be used with other Apify Actors as an integration.

## Features
- Fetch data from other Apify Actors
- Chunk data into smaller pieces 
- Compute embeddings (OpenAI, Cohere) with different models
- Store vectors in vector databases (Pinecone, Chroma)

## Code
Contains the core functionality for all the vector databases and integrations.

## Supported Vector Databases
- Pinecone
- Chroma
 
## Supported Vector Embeddings
- OpenAI
- Cohere
